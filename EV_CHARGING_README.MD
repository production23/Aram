# Analysis of Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Station Deployment

## Overview

This analysis explores the deployment of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations across various counties in California. 
The dataset provides information about the number of charging stations in each county for different quarters from Q3 2020 to Q4 2023.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information on EV charging station counts for each quarter from Q4 2023 to Q3 2020.

## Analysis

###Trends Over Time

We visualize the trends in EV charging station deployment over time by plotting the number of stations for each quarter. 
Scatter plots are used to show the distribution of charging stations across counties, while bar plots provide a comparison between quarters.

###County-wise Comparison

We analyze the deployment of EV charging stations on a county-by-county basis to identify variations in infrastructure across different regions.

###Seasonal Variations

We explore potential seasonal variations in deployment by comparing the number of stations across different quarters.

##Conclusion

This analysis provides insights into the progression of EV charging station deployment in California counties. 
By examining the data over time, we gain a better understanding of the state and evolution of EV charging infrastructure, 
which is essential for promoting the adoption of electric vehicles and sustainable transportation solutions.
